----------------------------------------------------------------------
note: lefthook could not install hooks automatically.

This usually means you have a `core.hooksPath` configured globally
(e.g. by your dotfiles or your employer). We did NOT change your git
config -- your existing hooks are untouched.

If you'd like this repo's lint/format/typecheck/commitlint hooks to
fire in addition, opt in locally. Both options affect THIS clone
only and can be reversed with `git config --local --unset core.hooksPath`.

  # Lefthook path (parallel, staged-files-aware, requires `npx lefthook`):
  git config --local core.hooksPath .git/hooks
  npx lefthook install --force

  # Zero-dependency fallback (sequential, whole-tree, no lefthook needed):
  git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks

Either one shadows your global hooks for this clone only. Pick the
trade-off you prefer.
