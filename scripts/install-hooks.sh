# Installs this repo's lefthook hooks into THIS clone's own `.git/hooks`
# and nowhere else. It never modifies your git config (local or global)
# and never writes into a hooks directory that config points at outside
# this repo. It exits 0 without installing anything when:
#
#   - running on CI, or under `npm pack` / `npm publish`;
#   - this package is not the root of its own git work tree (e.g. it was
#     installed as a dependency from a git URL or tarball, or lives
#     under a `node_modules` directory);
#   - `core.hooksPath` is set (globally or locally) to anything other
#     than this repo's own `.git/hooks`. In that case lefthook would
#     install its shims into that directory and rename your existing
#     hooks to `*.old`, so opt-in instructions are printed instead.
#
# CI runs lint/build/test on every PR regardless of local hooks, so
# skipping the local install is safe -- just slower feedback.

# Skip entirely on CI: no need to install git hooks in an ephemeral
# runner, and lefthook's platform-specific subpackage may not be
# resolved when the lockfile is missing cross-platform optional deps.

# subcommand; older versions don't, so we also check the

----------------------------------------------------------------------
note: this repo's git hooks were NOT installed automatically.

This usually means you have a `core.hooksPath` configured globally
(e.g. by your dotfiles or your employer). We did NOT change your git
config -- your existing hooks are untouched.

If you'd like this repo's lint/format/typecheck/commitlint hooks to
fire in addition, opt in locally. Both options affect THIS clone
only and can be reversed with `git config --local --unset core.hooksPath`.

  # Lefthook path (parallel, staged-files-aware, requires `npx lefthook`):
  git config --local core.hooksPath .git/hooks
  npx lefthook install --force

  # Zero-dependency fallback (sequential, whole-tree, no lefthook needed):
  git config --local core.hooksPath .githooks

Either one shadows your global hooks for this clone only. Pick the
trade-off you prefer.
